    "text": "Over the past several decades access to the internet has become much more universal across America; however, some families still do not have steady access to the internet. Using data from the 2021 5-year American Community Survey, I sought to determine the impact of household income and age on Americans’ access to the internet. I modeled internet access (a binary variable) using logistic regression. While increases in income were associated with increased log-odds of internet access, increases in age were associated with decreased log-odds of internet access. Holding income constant, for every one year increase in age, the odds of full internet access decreases by roughly 3%, and the effect of income on internet access increases with age."

It is important to note that the Intercept value should be disregarded as this indicates the log-odds of someone for whom both the predictors (age and household income) equal zero having full internet access. Considering that none of the confidence intervals include 0, these predictions appear reasonable. Most notably these estimates indicate that an increase by one year in age decreases the odds of having full internet access by roughly 3% and a one dollar increase in household income leads to a small increase in the odds of full internet access, which becomes more impactful with greater increases in income.\n\\[\n\\log\\left(\\frac{P(\\text{accessinet\\_binary} = 1)}{1 - P(\\text{accessinet\\_binary} = 1)}\\right)\n= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{agep} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{hincp} + \\beta_3 \\cdot (\\text{agep} \\times \\text{hincp})\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log\\left(\\frac{P(\\text{accessinet\\_binary} = 1)}{1 - P(\\text{accessinet\\_binary} = 1)}\\right)\n= 3.04 - 0.0339 \\cdot \\text{agep} + 0.00000704 \\cdot \\text{hincp} + 0.000000130 \\cdot (\\text{agep} \\times \\text{hincp})\n\\]\nThese equations reflect the mathematical structure of the model. In both equations predictors agep (age) and hincp (household income) are located on the right hand side of the equation. The right hand side reflects the log odds of the outcome variable (accessinet_binary, representing internet access) equaling one, which indicates full internet access. The bottom equation includes the model’s estimated coefficients, showing how the model would compute the log-odds of any person having full internet access based on age and household income."

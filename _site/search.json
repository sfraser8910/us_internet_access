    "text": "Over the past several years access to internet has become much more universal across America; however, some famillies still do not have steady access to the internet. Using data from the 2021 5-year American Community Survey, I seek to determine the impact of household income and age on Americans’ access to internet. I modeled internet access (a binary variable) using logistic regression. While incrases in income were associated with increased log-odds of internet access, increases in age were assocciated with decreased log-odds of internet access. Holding income constant, for every one year increase in age the log-odds of full internet access decreases by roughly 3% and the effect of income on internet access increases with age."
